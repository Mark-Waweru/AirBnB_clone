## 1.The Console
The first step of this project is to create a console which is a simple
command interpreter shell for
1. Creating a data model
2. Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via the console / command
interpreter
3. Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

## How to use the command Interpreter(Console)
- The command Interpreter is started by running the `console.py` script.
- After starting the interpreter, you can write the command `help` to see the
available commands and if you want to know what each command does you just type 
the command `help command`.
Example:
```console
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) help quit
Closes/exits the command interpreter
(hbnb) exit
Bye
$
```
